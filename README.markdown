# pickaxe

Pickaxe provides a simple way to load, solve and rate tests
(bundle of questions) written in simple text format.

Documentation can be read [here](http://dejw.github.com/pickaxe/).

**Note:** pickaxe was not tested on Windows yet (and it will not work there 
since `Pickaxe::Shell` executes some terminal related code).

## instalation

    sudo gem install Pickaxe
